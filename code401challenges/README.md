# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A function called reverse array which takes an array as an argument and returns an array with elements in reverse order.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Reverse the order of an inputed array

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
cycle through the array and reverse the order of the index values

# Array shift
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Insert a value into the middle of an array
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
cycle through the array and and insert the new value at the index equal to half of the length of the array

# Binary Search
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A function that  takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Returns the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenge Description
A function that  takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Returns the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Determine the mid point by first declaring the the start and end of an array.  Depending on whether the search key is less than, equal to, or greater than the mid point will determine the result.  If nothing is found, return -1.
